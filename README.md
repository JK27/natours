# Natours
Dynamic website for a travel agency where users can see the details and information about different tours and registered users can purchase them. Please click on the link to see the [deployed project[(https://natours-jk27.cyclic.app).

# Features
- You can log in using the details of one of the users already in the database. If you want to log in, you may use one of the following email adresses. The password for both of them is: "test1234".
  - laura@example.com
  - max@example.com
 - On the profile page of the logged in user, you can only update the personal information and see the bookings that user has made. The other two options on the side menu are not implemented and are purely for aesthetical purposes.
 - All users (authenticated or not) can see the information of each tour by clicking on the "details" button on each tour card in the main page.
 - Only authenticated users are able to book tours. To do so, click on the "BOOK TOUR NOW" button placed at the bottom of each tour page.
 - Once in the checkout page, use the card number "4242 4242 4242 4242", any future expiry date and any three digit CVC. You may also use any name and postcode.
